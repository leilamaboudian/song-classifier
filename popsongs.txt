FIREWORK

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin,
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing.
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you.
You just gotta ignite the light,
And let it shine.
Just own the night,
Like the Fourth of July.
'Cause baby, you're a firework.
Come on, show 'em what you're worth.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
As you shoot across the sky!
Baby, you're a firework.
Come on, let your colors burst.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.
You don't have to feel like a waste of space.
You're original, cannot be replaced.
If you only knew what the future holds.
After a hurricane comes a rainbow.
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road;
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow.
And when it's time, you'll know.
You just gotta ignite the light,
And let it shine.
Just own the night,
Like the Fourth of July.
'Cause baby, you're a firework.
Come on, show 'em what you're worth.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
As you shoot across the sky!
Baby, you're a firework.
Come on, let your colors burst.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.
Boom, boom, boom!
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon!
It's always been inside of you, you, you!
And now it's time to let it through!
'Cause baby, you're a firework.
Come on, show 'em what you're worth.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
As you shoot across the sky!
Baby, you're a firework.
Come on, let your colors burst.
Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh,"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe.
Boom, boom, boom!
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon!


BORN THIS WAY

It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M.
Just put your paws up.
'Cause you were born this way, baby!
My mama told me when I was young, "We are all born superstars."
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on in the glass of her boudoir.
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are", she said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe,
So hold your head up, girl, and you'll go far."
Listen to me when I say,
I'm beautiful in my way, 'cause God makes no mistakes.
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way.
Don't hide yourself in regret, just love yourself, and you're set.

Don't be a drag, just be a queen!
Don't be a drag, just be a queen!
Don't be a drag, just be a queen!
Give yourself prudence and love your friends.
Subway kid, rejoice your truth.
In the religion of the insecure, I must be myself, respect my youth.
A different lover is not a sin, believe capital H-I-M.
I love my life, I love this record, and
Mi amore vole fe.
I'm beautiful in my way 'cause God makes no mistakes.
I'm on the right track, baby, I was born this way.

You're Lebanese, you're Orient,
Whether life's disabilities left you outcast, bullied, or teased,
Rejoice and love yourself today,
'Cause, baby, you were born this way.
No matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender life,

Ooh, there ain't no other way, baby, I was born this way!
Same DNA, but born this way!
Same DNA, but born this way!


ON TOP OF THE WORLD

If you love somebody,
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you.
You'll never know what went well.
Then again it just depends on
How much time is left for you.
I've had the highest mountains,
I've had the deepest rivers,
You can have it all but not till you move it.
Now take it in but don't look down,
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
Waiting on this for a while now,
Paying my dues to the dirt,
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey!
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey!
Take it with me if I can,
Been dreaming of this since a child,
I'm on top of the world!
I've tried to cut these corners.
Try to take the easy way out.
I kept on falling short of something.
I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something.
Now take it in but don't look down,
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
Waiting on this for a while now,
Paying my dues to the dirt,
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey!
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey!
Take it with me if I can,
Been dreaming of this since a child,
I'm on top of the world!
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
Waiting on this for a while now,
Paying my dues to the dirt,
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey!
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey!
Take it with me if I can.
Been dreaming of this since a child.
And I know it's hard when you're falling down,
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground,
Get up now, get up, get up now.
And I know it's hard when you're falling down,
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground,
Get up now, get up, get up now.
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey!
I'm on top of the world!

CAN'T STOP THE FEELING

I got this feelin' inside my bones.
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on.
All through my city, all through my home,
We're flyin' up, no ceilin', when we in our zone.
I got that sunshine in my pocket,
Got that good soul in my feet.
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh),
I can't take my eyes up off it, movin' so phenomenally.
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop,
And under the lights when everything goes,
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close.
When we move, well, you already know,
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine,
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance!
Feel a good, good creepin' up on you,
So just dance, dance, dance, come on!
All those things I shouldn't do,
But you dance, dance, dance!
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'!
I can't stop the feelin'!
So just dance, dance, dance!
I can't stop the feelin'!
So just dance, dance, dance, come on!
Ooh, it's something magical.
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushin' on (rushin' on).
I don't need no reason, don't need control (need control).
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone.
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket,
Got that good soul in my feet.
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops (ooh),
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally.
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop.
Under the lights when everything goes,
Nowhere to hide when I'm gettin' you close.
When we move, well, you already know,
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine,
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance!
Feel a good, good, creepin' up on you,
So just dance, dance, dance, come on!
All those things I shouldn't do,
But you dance, dance, dance!
And ain't nobody leavin' soon, so keep dancin'!
I can't stop the feelin'!
Nothin' I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance!
Feel the good, good, creepin' up on you!
So just dance, dance, dance!
Break it down -
Can't stop the feelin'!


I'M YOURS

Well, you done done me in, you bet I felt it.
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted.
I fell right through the cracks.
Now I'm trying to get back!
Before the cool done run out,
I'll be giving it my bestest!
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.
But I won't hesitate no more, no more;
It cannot wait, I'm yours!
Well, open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love!
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing;
We're just one big family,
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved!
So I won't hesitate no more, no more;
It cannot wait, I'm sure!
There's no need to complicate,
Our time is short;
This is our fate, I'm yours!
Do, do, do, do you, do you, do, but do you want to come on?
Whoa-oh-oh,
Whoa-oh-oh,
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa,
Uh-huh, mmm-hmm!
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror,
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer,
But my breath fogged up the glass,
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.
But I won't hesitate no more, no more;
It cannot wait, I'm yours!
Well, open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
And look into your heart, and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't -
There's no need to complicate.
'Cause our time is short;
This, oh this, this is our fate, I'm yours!
Oh, I'm yours!
Oh, whoa, baby, do you believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours!


I WON'T GIVE UP

When I look into your eyes,
It's like watching the night sky,
Or a beautiful sunrise.
Well, there's so much they hold.
And just like them old stars,
I see that you've come so far,
To be right where you are.
How old is your soul?
Well, I won't give up on us.
Even if the skies get rough,
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating,
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find.
'Cause even the stars, they burn.
Some even fall to the earth.
We've got a lot to learn.
God knows we're worth it.
No, I won't give up!
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily.
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make.
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got - yeah, we got a lot at stake.
And in the end you're still my friend, at least we did intend.
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn.
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not,
And who I am.
I won't give up on us.
Even if the skies get rough,
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up.
I'm still looking up.
We got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved).
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it).
I won't give up on us.
Even if the skies get rough,
I'm giving you all my love.
I'm still looking up!


PUT YOUR RECORDS ON

Three little birds sat on my window,
And they told me I don't need to worry.
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet;
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right.
The more things seems to change, the more they stay the same.
Ooh, don't you hesitate!
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song,
You go ahead, let your hair down.
Sapphire and faded jeans,
I hope you get your dreams.
Just go ahead, let your hair down.
You're gonna find yourself (somewhere, somehow).
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely.
Sipping tea in a bar by the road side.
Don't you let those other boys fool you.
Gotta love that Afro hairdo.
Maybe sometimes we feel afraid, but it's all right.
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change.
Don't you think it's strange?
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song,
You go ahead, let your hair down.
Sapphire and faded jeans,
I hope you get your dreams.
Just go ahead, let your hair down.
You're gonna find yourself (somewhere, somehow).
Just more than I could take.
Pity for pity's sake.
Some nights kept me awake.
I thought that I was stronger!
When you gonna realize that you don't even have to try any longer?
(Do what you want to)
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song,
You go ahead, let your hair down.
Sapphire and faded jeans,
I hope you get your dreams.
Just go ahead, let your hair down.
Ooh, you're gonna find yourself (somewhere, somehow).


NO ONE

I just want you close,
Where you can stay forever.
You can be sure
That it will only get better.
You and me together,
Through the days and nights.
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright!
People keep talking, they can say what they like.
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright!
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling!
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you!
Can get in the way of what I feel for you!
When the rain is pouring down,
And my heart is hurting,
You will always be around.
This I know for certain!
You and me together,
Through the days and nights.
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright (yes, it will)!
People keep talking, they can say what they like.
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright!
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling!
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you!
Can get in the way of what I feel, say it!
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have.
I know people will try, try to divide something so real.
So 'til the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling!
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you!


DANCE WITH SOMEBODY

Clock strikes upon the hour,
And the sun begins to fade.
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away.
I've done alright up to now.
It's the light of day that shows me how.
And when the night falls, loneliness calls.
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.
I've been in love and lost my senses,
Spinning through the town.
Sooner or later, the fever ends,
And I wind up feeling down.
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls,
My lonely heart calls.
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.
Somebody ooh, Somebody ooh,
Somebody who loves me yeah!
Somebody ooh, Somebody ooh,
To hold me in his arms oh!
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls,
My lonely heart calls.
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody.
I wanna feel the heat with somebody.
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody,
With somebody who loves me.
Don'tcha wanna dance with me, baby?
Dontcha wanna dance with me, boy?
With somebody who loves me!


HOW WILL I KNOW

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of.
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mmm-hmm.
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh.
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?
Ooh, how will I know? (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know? (love can be deceiving)
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat.
I fall in love whenever we meet.
I'm asking you what you know about these things.
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak).
Falling in love is so bittersweet.
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking.
Wish I had you near me now, uh-huh.
Said there's no mistaking -
What I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me how will I know? (don't trust your feelings)
How will I know? (love can be deceiving)
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat.
I fall in love whenever we meet.
I'm asking you what you know about these things.
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
If he loves me!
If he loves me not!
Ooh, if he loves me!
Hey, if he loves me not!
Ooh, how will I know?
Hey, how will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat.
I fall in love whenever we meet.
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things.
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak).
Falling in love is so bittersweet.
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?
How will I know?(I say a prayer)
Ooh, how will I know? (I fall in love)


ALL OF ME

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you're kicking me out.
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin',
I can't pin you down.
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride,
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me,
But I'll be alright.
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine.
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you,
Love your curves and all your edges,
All your perfect imperfections.
Give your all to me;
I'll give my all to you.
You're my end and my beginnin',
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'.
'Cause I give you all of me!
And you give me all of you, oh-oh!
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too.
The world is beating you down; I'm around
Through every mood.
You're my downfall, you're my muse,
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you.
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine.
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you,
Love your curves and all your edges,
All your perfect imperfections.
Give your all to me;
I'll give my all to you.
You're my end and my beginnin'.
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'.
'Cause I give you all of me!
And you give me all of you, oh-oh!
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts,
Risking it all, though it's hard.
Give your all to me.
I'll give my all to you.
You're my end and my beginnin'.
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'.
'Cause I give you all of me!
And you give me all of you, oh-oh!


LOVE ME NOW

Pulling me further,
Further than I've been before.
Making me stronger,
Shaking me right to the core, oh.
I don't know what's in the stars,
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours.
But I know what's in my heart;
If you ain't mine I'll be torn apart.
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone,
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have!
I know it'll kill me when it's over.
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now.
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone,
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have!
I know it'll kill me when it's over.
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now.
Love me now (love me now),
Love me now (love me now),
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah!
Love me now (love me now),
Love me now (love me now),
I want you to love me now!
Something inside us,
Knows there's nothing guaranteed, yeah.
Girl, I don't need you
To tell me that you'll never leave, no.
When we've done all that we could
To turn darkness into light, turn evil to good,
Even when we try so hard,
For that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart.
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have!
And I know it'll kill me when it's over.
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now.
Love me now (love me now),
Love me now (love me now),
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah!
Love me now,
Love you now,
Love me now,
Oh love you now!
Oh oh oh!


CONVERSATIONS IN THE DARK

Talk,
Let's have conversations in the dark.
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you!
With you.

Movies that we've both already seen.
I ain't even looking at the screen, it's true.
I got my eyes on you!
And you say that you're not worth it,
You get hung up on your flaws,
Well, in my eyes you are perfect,
As you are.
I will never try to change you, change you.
I will always want the same you, same you.
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart.

Keep the secrets that you told me, told me.
And your love is all you owe me,
And I won't break your heart.
On,
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon.
Well, I can sleep forever next to you!
Next to you.
And we,
We got places we both gotta be.
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Then blow off all my plans for you!
And you say that you're not worth it,
And get hung up on your flaws,
But in my eyes you are perfect,
As you are.
As you are.

I will always want the same you, same you.
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart.

And your love is all you owe me.
And I won't break your heart.


BIGGER LOVE

I don't wanna think about nothing.
Just watching you dancing.
Feel like the beginning of something.
In the end, in the end,
All I wanna do is just fall in.
I don't wanna think about nothing.
Everybody got so much to say,
Every time we push it away,
Every day, a new reason to stay,
'Cause we got a bigger love.
Won't ever give it up.
We got a one-way ticket love.
We ain't going no place but up.
Nothing can stop this,
No one can top us,
We got a bigger love.
I don't wanna think about nothing.
The world feels like it's crumbling.
Everyday, another new something.
But in the end, in the end,
Can't nobody do us in.
I just wanna think about loving.
'Cause we got a bigger love.
Won't ever give it up.
We got a one-way ticket love.
We ain't going no place but up.
Nothing can stop this,
No one can top us,
We got a bigger love.
We got a bigger love.
Won't ever give it up, no!
We got a one-way ticket love.
We ain't going no place but up.
Nothing can stop this (no),
No one can top us,
We got a bigger love!
