BEFORE HE CHEATS

Right now, he's probably slow dancin'
With a bleached-blond and she's probably gettin' frisky.
Right now, he's probably buyin' her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey.
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showin' her how to shoot a combo,
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seats;
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,
I slashed a hole in all four tires.
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke.
Right now, she's probably sayin' "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky.
Right now, he's probably dabbin' on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo.
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive.
Carved my name into his leather seats;
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,
I slashed a hole in all four tires.
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
A-'cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me,
No, not on me.
'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seats;
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,
I slashed a hole in all four tires.
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats,
Oh, before he cheats.


DON'T TAKE THE GIRL

Johnny's daddy, was takin' him fishing
When he was eight years old.
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole.
His dad looked down and smiled.
Said we can't leave her behind.
Son I know you don't want her to go.
But someday you'll change your mind.
And Johnny said,
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson,
Take my best friend Bo.
Take anybody that you want as, long as she don't go.
Take any boy in the world.
Daddy please, don't take the girl.
Same old boy, same sweet girl,
Ten years down the road.
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show.
Stranger came and pulled a gun,
Grabbed her by the arm,
Said if you do what I tell you to there
Won't be any harm.
And Johnny said,
Take my money, take my wallet,
Take my credit cards,
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me,
Here's the key to my car.
Mister give it a whirl,
But please, don't take the girl.
Same old boy, same sweet girl.
Five years down the road.
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says it's time to go;
Doctor says the baby's fine,
But you'll have to leave,
'Cause his momma's fading fast and, Johnny hit his knees.
And there he prayed
Take the very, breath you gave me,
Take the heart from my chest.
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me,
Make this my last request:
Take me out of this world;
God please, don't take the girl.


SOMEONE ELSE CALLING YOU

I saw a truck backin' out of your drive.
You were sitting in the passenger side.
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe.
Two weeks ago that was you and me.
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'.
Baby is someone else calling you baby?
It's driving me crazy,
This bein in the dark.
Goodbye's never easy,
So break it to me hard.
If you're over my love girl,
Lay it on my heart.
Don't try to save me;
Is someone else calling you baby?
You wanted time and you wanted your space,
So I backed off, did whatever it takes,
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along,
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on.
It'll be what it will be, it's either him or me.
Give me the word and girl I'm gone.
Baby is someone else calling you baby?
It's driving me crazy,
This bein in the dark.
Goodbye's never easy,
So break it to me hard.
If you're over my love girl,
Lay it on my heart.
Don't try to save me.
Is someone else calling you baby?
Goodbye's never easy,
So break it to me hard.
If you're over my love girl,
Lay it on my heart.
Don't try to save me.
Is someone else calling you baby?
Girl, don't try to save me;
Is someone else calling you baby?


OL RED

Now, Ol' Red, he's the damnedest dog
That I've ever seen.
Got a nose that can smell a two day trail.
He's a four legged trackin' machine.
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds,
But all these years that I've been here,
Ain't nobody got past Red.
And the warden sang
Come on somebody, why don't you run?
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun.
Get my lantern, get my gun,
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes.
Well, I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee.
Oh, and he brought down a blue tick hound,
She was pretty as she could be.
Well, they penned her up in the swampland,
'Bout a mile just south of the gate.
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run,
I'd just drop him off and wait.
And the warden sang,
Come on somebody, why don't you run?
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun.


THE DANCE

Looking back
On the memory of
The dance we shared,
'Neath the stars above;
For a moment,
All the world was right.
But how could I have known
That you'd ever say goodbye?
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end,
The way it all would go.
Our lives are better left to chance.
I could have missed the pain,
But I'd have had to miss the dance.
Holding you,
I held everything.
For a moment,
Wasn't I the king?
If I'd only known
How the king would fall.
Hey, who's to say,
You know I might have changed it all.
And now I'm glad I didn't know
The way it all would end,
The way it all would go.
Our lives are better left to chance.
I could have missed the pain,
But I'd have had to miss the dance.


BROKEN ROAD

I set out on a narrow way, many years ago,
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road.
But I got lost, a time or two,
Wiped my brow, and kept pushing through.
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you,
That every long lost dream led me to where you are.
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars,
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms.
This much I know is true:
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you.
Yes, He did.
I think about the years I spent just passin' through.
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you.
But you just smile and take my hand,
You've been there, you understand,
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true.
Every long lost dream led me to where you are.
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars,
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms.
This much I know is true:
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you.


HERE COMES GOODBYE

I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road,
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio,
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell.
She usually comes right in, now I can tell.
Here comes goodbye.
Here comes the last time.
Here comes the start of every sleepless night,
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry.
Here comes the pain,
Here comes me wishing things had never changed.
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye.
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday.
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way.
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side,
And violins would play here comes the bride.
Here comes goodbye.
Here comes the last time.
Here comes the start of every sleepless night,
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry.
Here comes the pain,
Here comes me wishing things had never changed.
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye.
Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and youre left alone,
All alone, but here comes goodbye.
Here comes goodbye.
Here comes the last time.
Here comes the start of every sleepless night,
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry.
Here comes the pain,
Here comes me wishing things had never changed.


DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT

I left out in a cloud of taillights and dust.
Swore I wasn't coming back, said I'd had enough.
Saw you in the rear view standing, fading from my life.
But I wasn't turnin' 'round,
No, not this time.
But don't think I don't think about it.
Don't think I don't have regrets.
Don't think it don't get to me.
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey,
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been, all worked out.
I know what I felt, and I know what I said,
But don't think I don't think about it.
When we make choices, we gotta live with them.
Heard you found a real good man and you married him.
I wonder if sometimes I cross your mind.
Where would we be today
If I never drove that car away?
But don't think I don't think about it.
Don't think I don't have regrets.
Don't think it don't get to me.
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey,
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been, all worked out.
Yeah, I know what I felt, and I know what I said.
But don't think I don't think about it,
But don't think I don't think about it,
But don't think I don't think about it.
Don't think I don't have regrets.
Don't think it don't get to me.
Between the work and the hurt and the whiskey,
Don't think I don't wonder 'bout
Could've been, should've been, all worked out.
I know what I felt, and I know what I said.
But don't think I don't think about it,
Don't think I don't.


JOLENE

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,
I'm begging of you please don't take my man.
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,
Please don't take him just because you can.
Your beauty is beyond compare,
With flaming locks of auburn hair,
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.
Your smile is like a breath of spring,
Your voice is soft like summer rain,
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene.
He talks about you in his sleep,
And there's nothing I can do to keep
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene.
And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man,
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene.
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,
I'm begging of you please don't take my man.
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,
Please don't take him just because you can.
You could have your choice of men,
But I could never love again.
He's the only one for me, Jolene.
I had to have this talk with you,
My happiness depends on you,
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene.


SHE'LL LEAVE YOU WITH A SMILE

At first she's gonna come on strong,
Like she'll love you all night long,
Like it's going out of style,
Then she'll leave you with a smile.
You're gonna give her all your heart,
Then she'll tear your world apart.
You're gonna cry a little while,
Still she'll leave you with a smile.
Well, you can't help but wonder,
Why you can't help but love her.
But you can't help love her,
And all that hurtin' was more than worth it.
It's written all over your face.
One day you'll pass her on the street
With that guy you used to be.
She'll say hello and walk on by.
Then she'll leave you with a smile.


BECAUSE OF YOU

I will not make the same mistakes that you did.
I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
I will not break the way you did.
You fell so hard.
I've learned the hard way, to never let it get that far.
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt,
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
Because of you
I am afraid.
I lose my way.
And it's not too long before you point it out.
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes.
I'm forced to fake a smile, a laugh
Every day of my life.
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with.
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side, so I don't get hurt,
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
Because of you
I am afraid.
I watched you die,
I heard you cry,
Every night in your sleep.
I was so young;
You should have known better
Than to lean on me.
You never thought of anyone else.
You just saw your pain.
And now I cry
In the middle of the night
For the same damn thing.
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt,
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
Because of you
I am afraid.
Because of you.


WHAT HURTS THE MOST

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house;
That don't bother me.
I can take a few tears now and then, and just let 'em out.
I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while even though
Going on with you gone still upsets me.
There are days every now and again
I pretend I'm okay,
But that's not what gets me.
What hurts the most
Was being so close,
And having so much to say,
And watching you walk away,
And never knowing
What could've been,
And not seeing that love in you,
Is what I was trying to do.
It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go,
But I'm doing it.
It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends.
And I'm alone.
Still harder getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret.
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken.
What hurts the most
Is being so close,
And having so much to say,
And watching you walk away,
And never knowing
What could've been,
And not seeing that love in you,
Is what I was trying to do.
Hey, yeah.
Not seeing that love in you.
That's what I was trying to do.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.


KEEP IT TO YOURSELF

You turn on the light,
Then you turn it back off.
'Cause sleepin' alone, yeah, it ain't what you thought.
It's the drip of the sink,
It's the click of the clock,
And you're wonderin' if I'm sleepin'.
You heard from your friends
That I'm doin' okay,
And you're thinkin' that maybe you made a mistake.
And you want me to know,
But I don't wanna know
How you're feelin'.
Keep it to yourself.
If you think that you still love me,
Put it on a shelf.
If you're looking for someone,
Make it someone else.
When you're drunk
And it's late
And you're missin' me like hell,
Keep it to yourself.
If you see me out and I'm standin' alone,
Well, it don't mean that I'm gonna need a ride home.
If you walk up to me like it ain't what it is,
I know that it ain't gonna end with a kiss.
So keep it to yourself.
If you think that you still love me,
Put it on a shelf.
If you're lookin' for someone,
Make it someone else.
When you're drunk,
And it's late,
And you're missin' me like hell,
Just keep it to yourself.
Yeah, keep it to yourself.
Yeah, when you're drunk,
And it's late,
And you're sad,
And you hate goin' home alone,
'Cause you're missin' me like hell,
Keep it to yourself.
Yeah, keep it to yourself.
Mm, mm, mm, mm.
