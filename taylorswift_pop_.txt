22

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes.
Ah-ah, ah-ah.
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers.
Ah-ah, ah-ah.
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time.
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines.
It's time, oh-oh.
I don't know about you,
But I'm feeling 22.
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me,
But I'll bet you want to.
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22.
It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded,
Too many cool kids.
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene,
And end up dreamin' instead of sleeping, yeah.
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way.
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah.
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks.
It's time, oh-oh.
I don't know about you,
But I'm feeling 22.
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you.
You don't know about me,
But I'll bet you want to.
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22, 22.
I don't know about you.
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah.
22 (Dancing like),
22 (Yeah, yeah),
22 (Yeah, yeah, yeah).
It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene.
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping.
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news.
I gotta have you.
I gotta have you.


YOU ARE IN LOVE

One look, dark room.
Meant just for you.
Time moved too fast.
You play it back.
Buttons on a coat,
Light-hearted joke.
No proof, not much,
But you saw enough.
Small talk, he drives,
Coffee at midnight.
The light reflects
The chain on your neck.
He says, "look up,"
And your shoulders brush.
No proof, one touch,
But you felt enough.
You can hear it in the silence, silence,
You can feel it on the way home, way home,
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love.
You are in love.
Morning, his place.
Burnt toast, Sunday.
You keep his shirt.
He keeps his word.
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts.
One step, not much,
But it said enough.
You kiss on sidewalks,
You fight and you talk.
One night he wakes,
Strange look on his face.
Pauses, then says,
You're my best friend.
And you knew what it was.
He is in love.
You can hear it in the silence, silence,
You can feel it on the way home, way home,
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love.
And so it goes.
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round,
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown,
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars,
And why I've spent my whole life tryin' to put it into words.
'Cause you can hear in the silence,
You can feel it on the way home,
You can see it with the lights out,
You are in love, true love.
You are in love.


LOVER

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January,
And this is our place, we make the rules,
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear.
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my
Lover.
We could let our friends crash in the living room,
This is our place, we make the call,
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you.
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all.
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my
Lover.
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand,
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover.
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue.
All's well that ends well to end up with you.
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover.
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me.
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover.
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home.
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover.


PAPER RINGS

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet.
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed.
The wine is cold,
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street.
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three.
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe.
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night.
(Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright.
Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life.
(One, two, one two three four!)
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings,
Uh huh, that's right.
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this,
Uh huh, that's right.
Darling, you're the one I want.
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams,
Oh, you're the one I want.
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool,
When you jumped in first, I went in too.
I'm with you even if it makes me blue.
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall.
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws,
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night.
(Oh!) Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright.
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life.
(One, two, one two three four!)
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings,
Uh huh, that's right.
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this,
Uh huh, that's right.
Darling, you're the one I want.
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams,
Oh, you're the one I want.
I want to drive away with you,
I want your complications too,
I want your dreary Mondays,
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy!
Uh huh!
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings,
Uh huh, that's right.
You're the one I want.
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this,
Uh huh.
Darling, you're the one I want.
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams,
You're the one I want.
In paper rings, in picture frames, and all my dreams,
Oh, you're the one I want.
You're the one I want, one I want.


ME

I promise that you'll never find another like me.
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh,
I know I never think before I jump.
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want.
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone.
I never leave well enough alone,
And trouble's gonna follow where I go.
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
But one of these things is not like the others,
Like a rainbow with all of the colors.
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover,
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm the only one of me.
Baby, that's the fun of me.
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
You're the only one of you.
Baby, that's the fun of you.
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e!
I know I tend to make it about me,
I know you never get just what you see,
But I will never bore you, baby.
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain,
You ran after me and called my name.
I never wanna see you walk away.
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
'Cause one of these things is not like the others.
Livin' in winter, I am your summer,
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover,
I promise that you'll never find another like
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
I'm the only one of me.
Let me keep you company.
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
You're the only one of you.
Baby, that's the fun of you.
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e!


DAYLIGHT

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in.
Everyone looked worse in the light.
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven.
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye.
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you.
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you.
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night.
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight.
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky,
And so I became the butt of the joke.
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked,
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke.
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down.
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town.
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now,
It's brighter now, now.
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you.
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you.
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night.
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight).
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight!
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight!
And I can still see it all, in my mind,
All of you, all of me, intertwined.
I once believed love would be black and white,
But it's golden.
And I can still see it all,
Back and forth from New York,
I once believed love would be burning red,
But it's golden.
Like daylight, daylight!
Like daylight, daylight!
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you.
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you.
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night.
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight!
It's golden like daylight.
I wanna be defined by the things that I love,
Not the things I hate,
Not the things that I'm afraid of,
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.
I just think that
You are what you love!
