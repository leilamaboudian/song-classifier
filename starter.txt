# "starting idea of the source texts you might use for this project's comparisons"

Song experiment idea:
1) Main text: a script of country lyrics (e.g, Blake Shelton...).
2) Main text: a script of pop lyrics (e.g, Selena Gomez...).
3) Compare (mains) to: a script of (for example) Taylor Swift lyrics (country and pop).
4) Compare (mains) to: a script of soul lyrics - for example, Aretha Franklin.

# ULTIMATELY NOT USED.

Book experiment idea:
1) Main text: a sci-fi book (e.g, Jules Verne or Douglas Adams - Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy).
2) Main text: a "classic" book (e.g, Jane Austen).
3) Compare (mains) to: a "classic sci-fi" book (e.g, Mary Shelley - Frankenstein).
4) Compate (mains) to: another classic book (or even another Jane Austen).
   -> This (4) will hopefully confirm the accuracy of the program.
