PROJECT TITLE: CS5 (Introduction to Python, Harvey Mudd) final.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 'final.py' categorizes music into country or pop genre by comparing the subject to 'popsongs.txt', a file containing lyrics from a collection of pop songs, and 'countrysongs.txt', a file containing lyrics from a collection of country songs.

AUTHOR: Leila Maboudian.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 'taylorswift*pop*.txt' has lyrics from a collection of pop songs by Taylor Swift, while 'taylorswift*country*.txt' has lyrics from a collection of country songs by Taylor Swift. Users will find that 'final.oy' correctly categorizes the pop music as pop and the country music as country, though not for every factor.
*Because this was a final project from a Harvey Mudd summer course, many of the files chart the progress of the project: 'starter.py' was the earliest, then 'milestone.py,' and 'final.py' was the complete final.
