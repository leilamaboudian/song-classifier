So far, this project has been very informative -- it has taught me so much about Python dictionaries and the significance of object-oriented programming.

I chose to have my additional parameter create a dictionary representing the distribution of sentence objectivity and polarity in a text.
-> This was done using sentiment analysis in Python's TextBlob library (thanks to an article from Analytics Vidhya).

To be honest, the biggest challenge has been deciding on what texts I want to compare -- or really, what I think would make the most meaningful "experiment".

I am at the milestone point, and hope that, once I finish the remaining functions and run my tests, my "experiment" will have clear, logical results.
