# CS5: song classifier
## Bayesian Classifier to categorize songs by genre
_CS5 (Introduction to Python, Harvey Mudd) final_
AUTHOR: Leila Maboudian.


PURPOSE OF PROJECT: [final.py](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/final.py) categorizes music into country or pop genre by comparing the subject to [popsongs.txt](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/popsongs.txt), a file containing lyrics from a collection of pop songs, and [countrysongs.txt](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/countrysongs.txt), a file containing lyrics from a collection of country songs.


USER INSTRUCTIONS: [taylorswift_pop_.txt](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/taylorswift_pop_.txt) has lyrics from a collection of pop songs by Taylor Swift, while [taylorswift_country_.txt](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/taylorswift_country_.txt) has lyrics from a collection of country songs by Taylor Swift. Users will find that [final.py](https://github.com/leilamaboudian/song-classifier/blob/main/final.py)* correctly categorizes the pop music as pop and the country music as country, though not for every factor.


*_Because this was a final project from a Harvey Mudd summer course, many of the included files chart the progress of the project: starter.py was the earliest script, then milestone.py, and final.py was the complete final._
